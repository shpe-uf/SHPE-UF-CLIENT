# Frontend code for the SHPE UF web page

## Scripts

#npm install

Installs the node_modules folder needed to run the client

#npm start

Runs the client in development mode, on develop it uses localhost:5000 as server and on master it uses shpe-uf.herokuapp.com

#Build scripts

Build scripts are not included in this readme beacause the build is deployed on Netlify, which runs these for us
